Background Study:To develop this project from the starch brainstorming was needed and in Bangladesh there is noE-commerce website that developed based on Arts. And for that the idea came to develop this kind of website and for that some reference were gathered to develop this platformthey arehttps://www.pinterest.com/and https://www.deviantart.com/where Pinterestis an American image sharing and social media service designed to enable saving and discovery ofinformation (specifically "ideas") on the internet using images and, on a smaller scale, animated GIFs and videos in the form of pinboards.
